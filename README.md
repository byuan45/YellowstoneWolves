# YellowstoneWolves
Project for CS 4460: Information Visualization
Team BAD DAB - Darby Foster, Abby Stuart, Brandon Yuan

Our project is structured as a website and hosted via GitHub Pages, accessible at https://byuan45.github.io/YellowstoneWolves/. The top of the website includes a navigation bar that allows users to switch between pages, each showing different information about the wolf population of Yellowstone National Park, including text and/or data visualizations. The code for the navigation bar is included in index.html. Clicking on each tab links to a new HTML file for the desired tab. The content of each page, including any JavaScript, is included in that HTML file. For the pages that contain data visualizations, while each visualization has some interactivity, interacting with one visualization does not affect any of the other visualizations on other pages.
