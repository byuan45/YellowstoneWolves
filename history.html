        Gray Wolves are one of Yellowstone’s most important predators, and they
        were an integral part of the landscape and ecosystem for thousands of
        years, when their populations started declining due to efforts by the
        U.S. government. They were completely extinct in the area by the 1920s,
        which had an extreme impact on the ecosystem. Since the wolves were the
        main predator of the area, their prey naturally started growing in
        numbers, and there was a population boom of elk and coyotes, causing a
        decrease in beavers, willow, and aspen. The ecosystem was severely
        imbalanced.
        <br />
        <br />
        Things started to change, however, in the 1970s. The US passed some
        environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, which was the
        beginning of a new life for the gray wolves. They were listed as
        endangered in 1974, which mandated their recovery, so the National Park
        Service was able to begin planning their return to Yellowstone.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many years of planning were required, but finally, in January 1995,
        fourteen gray wolves were captured from Canada and released into
        Yellowstone. The next year, seventeen more wolves were brought in from
        outside, then ten more in 1997. The wolves established themselves into
        packs and breeding pairs, and populations grew quickly.
        <br />
        <br />
        This historical event was the first ever attempt at re-introducing a
        dominant carnivore to an ecosystem, and it was certainly successful, as
        Yellowstone’s ecosystem is balanced once again. Follow the tabs above in
        order to learn more about the wolves and how they have progressed since
        their re-introduction.
